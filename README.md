Mix2Meat

Mix2Meat is a simple web-based calculator designed for people who want to use prepackaged seasoning mixes and BBQ rubs to make sausage but aren’t sure how much seasoning to add. 
It takes into account the sodium content listed on your spice mix’s nutrition label, your meat weight, and your desired salt percentage to calculate the right amount of seasoning. 
It can also help you calculate curing salt (Prague Powder #1) if you’re making cured sausages.
